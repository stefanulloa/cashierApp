Cashier is an application for phones to manage expenses with your friends. You can create events with other users and be able to manage all of the different aspects that make up the whole budget of an event. This way friends can assign their expenses in a more clear way. Moreover, Cashier offers a way to register each expense and the user who is in charge of it so that there are no misunderstandings.  
It needs improvements of existing functionalities as well as the addition of others (chat, stats of expenses, etc).
This app was developed with javascript, node and redis as a full-stack project.
